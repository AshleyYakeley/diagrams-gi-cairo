0.5: 9 March 2012

  * New features

    - New Diagrams.Backend.Cairo.Text module by Michael Sloan, with
      functions for creating appropriately sized text objects by
      querying cairo for the size, and related supporting functions.

    - Basic support for animation, by generating frames sampled at
      regular intervals.

    - Proper vertical alignment of default text based on font
      parameters (Michael Sloan).

    - Requesting just a width or height now causes the other to be
      computed appropriately.

  * API changes

    - Move "Diagrams.Backend.Cairo" to
      "Diagrams.Backend.Cairo.Internal" and export everything.
      "Diagrams.Backend.Cairo" now just re-exports selected functions
      from Internal.  This allows anyone who wants access to the
      helper/utility functions to import Internal.

  * Dependency/version changes

    - relax cmdargs upper bound
    - GHC 7.4.1 compatibility: update base, filepath, old-time upper bounds

  * Bug fixes

    - #54: Generate warning for missing image files (Ian Ross).
